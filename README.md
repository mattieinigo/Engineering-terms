This Python project is a simple Engineering Dictionary that lets users store and look up engineering terms. Users can add terms with their definitions, and the program saves them in a list. When searching, the dictionary checks for the term and displays its meaning. If the term isn’t found, the user is informed. It’s a basic yet effective tool for organizing engineering concepts.
